You will love getting gooey with Unity’s new GUI!

Do you remember the old Unity UI system? It required you to write all your GUI code in OnGUI. It was slow, inefficient and programmer-centric, going against the visual nature of Unity. Many developers chose instead to use third party tools such as NGUI.

Thankfully, Unity Technologies listened to community feedback and worked out a new system, released in Unity 4.6.

In this three-part series, you’ll explore Unity’s new UI system by adding an interactive UI to a game called Rocket Mouse.

To satisfy users’ cravings for an engaging UI, you’ll also learn to:

- Animate buttons
- Create a settings dialog that slides into a scene
- Use more GUI controls like Text, Slider, Panel and Mask


　

# Getting Started

This tutorial is aimed at those familiar with the Unity Editor. Go check out our Introduction to Unity series if this is your first rodeo. The great news is that as this tutorial focuses on the UI system, it is 95% script free!

```
Note: Keep in mind that this tutorial does not cover the creation of the game itself. The goal here is to provide an introduction to Unity’s UI system and familiarize you with its components.

You’ll need some images for backgrounds, buttons and other UI elements, as well as a few fonts

You’ll need some images for backgrounds, buttons and other UI elements, as well as a few fonts for the labels and buttons. Don’t worry, you won’t have to draw anything yourself or scour the web for the right assets. I’ve prepared a special package that has everything you need. You’re welcome. :]
