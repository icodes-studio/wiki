*Update February 2019: This tutorial was updated to Unity 2018.3 by Ben MacKinnon. Original post by [**Kirill Muzykov**](https://twitter.com/kmuzykov).*

Welcome back! In [**part one**](https://github.com/icodes-studio/wiki/blob/main/STUDY%2BRND/Unity3D%20Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20Unity%20UI/PART%231.md) of this three-part tutorial series, you created a scene with two buttons. You learned how to use the Image, Button and Text UI controls, and you learned core concepts such as RectTransform, Anchors and Pivots. That’s a lot of skills to learn in one tutorial! However, the scene itself is pretty simple.

In this tutorial, you’ll spruce up the scene by adding animations, a settings dialog and more UI controls like Slider and Toggle.
